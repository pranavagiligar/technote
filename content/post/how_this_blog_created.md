This blog is result of my second try to create effecient blog. My first try is with[ Ghost blog](https://ghost.org/), which is a NodeJs based multi-author blog server. The Ghost blog has good community, good collection of themes, good for multiple author, good for non geek and final and most important is huge collection of [Ghost integrations](https://ghost.org/integrations/) with other services like Zapier, Disqus, Formspree, etc.

Ghost is good but when it comes to backup and import, it is horible. Second disadvantage is not having a good version controlling. There is another one which only matters when you host with limited budget, which is it takes good amount of RAM. It got crashed when I try to upload a photo using admin pannel because I have hosting it on a  `RaspberryPi 3B+` (which is of 1GB RAM).

This blog is created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a static site generator and it is the fastest blog and convenient to host static content for geeks!. Hugo is not only easy to setup but also freedom of choice in hosting. There are numrious static content host provider out there with free plan. Free plan is enough for hobby and personal blog. And you only need to know about Mark down syntax. Since project structure is so simple, backup is done with simply commit changes to `Git`. But unlike Ghost, the Hugo is good for single author blog.
